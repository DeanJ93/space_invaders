# Space Invaders - Turtle Graphics

## About
I built this game to practice game development with Turtle Graphics and OOP. I wanted to challenge myself by building something myself without following a tutorial.

This game uses Pygame to play the sound effects for cross-platform compatibility. I've only tested it on Windows though.

## Requirements
- Python must be installed
- Pygame must be installed

### Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install required dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Play
- Press the **left** and **right arrow keys** to move.
- Press the **space bar** to shoot.

## Starting the Game
Run the following command:
```sh
python space_invaders.py
```

## Note
I'm still learning OOP so this might not be the best implementation. I may consider improving the code in the future.
